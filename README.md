# UKCORDEX-plot-explorer-dev

This repo is the development version of [the UKCORDEX Plot Explorer](https://github.com/UCL/UKCORDEX-plot-explorer). We use it to test new changes and make non-production releases to share at the end of each sprint with the research team for feedback.

You can see the latest deployed live version [here](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/UKCORDEX-plot-explorer-dev/). Please note the latest version of the repo can be unstable as we might be carrying out work in progress.

To submit new feature requests or issue, please do so [in the production repository](https://github.com/UCL/UKCORDEX-plot-explorer/issues/new).
