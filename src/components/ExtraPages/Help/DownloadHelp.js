        <p>The plot explorer provides the option to download the data used to produce the plots, as well as the plots themselves.
          <br></br>
          The data is provided in netcdf4 format, and each file contains only the data used to produce the selected plot.
          Jupyter notebooks containing the Python code used to produce the plots are currently in development and will be provided via Binder.
