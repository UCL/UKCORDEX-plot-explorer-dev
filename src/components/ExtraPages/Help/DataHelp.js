              Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) experiment. This ensemble

              EuroCORDEX also provides a single evaluation run for each of its
              ten RCMs (Table 2), forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis rather than
              by GCM output. These runs allow us to evaluate the performance of
              the RCMs in the absence of errors or biases inherited from the
              driving GCMs. The evaluation periods for which these runs were
              produced differ between models, with only the period from December
              1989 to November 2008 covered by all of the models: this
              constrains the period used to evaluate the historical performance
              of the models.
