          How to use this plot explorer to select a suitable subset of ensemble
          members
        </h1>
        <p>
          In situations where only a small number of ensemble members (i.e.
          model runs) can be used, it is recommended that they are chosen so as
          to be as representative as possible of the entire ensemble, with
          respect to the specific climate indices that are most relevant in the
          context of the application. To achieve this, users are advised to
          identify and focus on the dominant sources of variation of these
          indices within the ensemble. For example, in a situation where the
          GCMs are responsible for 90% of the variation in the indices of
          interest, the chosen sample of ensemble members should contain runs
          driven by contrasting GCMs but the choice of RCM is relatively
          unimportant.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dominant sources of variation in an ensemble are index-dependent.
          To identify a appropriate set of ensemble members for use in
          applications examining the impacts of, or adaptation to, future
          changes in UK climate, a suggested usage of this plot explorer tool
          is:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Having identified the most relevant{" "}
            <Link to="/indices-help"> climate indices</Link>, seasons and{" "}
            <Link to="/time-help">time period</Link>, examine the boxplots
            showing the corresponding overall UK-averaged distribution(s) of
            future changes for the time period of interest. This will indicate
            the extent to which any <Link to="/plot-help">ensemble</Link>{" "}
            captures the full range of variation; for the EuroCORDEX ensemble,
            the boxplots can also give a preliminary indication as to whether
            one potential source of variation (e.g. the GCMs) is highly
            dominant, since this will manifest itself via clustering of the
            plotted values by colour or plotting symbol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Examine maps showing the{" "}
            <Link to="/plot-help">ANOVA decomposition</Link> of the ensemble for
            the indices of interest. The plot titles quantify the overall
            partitioning of variation across the UK, and hence formalise the
            preliminary indications from the boxplots. Users working on
            applications in a specific part of the UK are advised to use the
            maps to determine whether the overall partitioning is representative
            of their area of interest â€” for example, for some indices the GCMs
            are dominant overall but the RCMs play a more important role in
            urban areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            For indices where the GCMs contribute an appreciable component of
            the total ensemble variation, examine maps of the first two GCM{" "}
            <Link to="/plot-help">ensemble principal patterns</Link> (EPPs) and
            their scores. If the first EPP accounts for most of the
            GCM-attributable variation, then this suggests choosing ensemble
            members driven by GCMs with scores extending along the range of the
            first EPP (horizontal axis); if the second EPP also accounts for a
            substantial amount of variation, then the selected GCMs should also
            have scores extending along the range of the second EPP (vertical
            axis). A similar approach can be used to identify an appropriate
            subset of RCMs, in situations where these contribute appreciably to
            the ensemble variation.
          </li>
          <li>
            For indices where the residual component of variation is dominant in
            the region of interest, users may either select a random sample of
            ensemble runs, or examine <Link to="/plot-help">stamp plots</Link>{" "}
            of the individual runs and select a sample that spans the range of
            values.
          </li>
          <li>
            In situations where the guidelines above do not allow users to
            identify a clear subset of ensemble members to use,{" "}
            <Link to="/plot-help">Taylor diagrams</Link> and{" "}
            <Link to="/plot-help">maps of biases</Link> for the selected indices
            over the evaluation period may be used to identify the runs that
            best reproduce relevant aspects of historical climate by comparison
            with observations: there is an argument for prioritising these runs
            for inclusion in any sample. It is worth noting, however, that a
            GCM:RCM combination that reproduces historical climate well is not
            necessarily guaranteed to provide the most reliable estimates of
            future change. Selecting runs solely on the basis of past
            performance is not necessarily the most appropriate strategy
            therefore: this is why we suggest first identifying the combinations
            that span the range of future change in an ensemble.
