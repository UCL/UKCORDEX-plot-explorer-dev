    "In situations where only a small number of ensemble members (i.e. model runs) can be used, it is recommended that they are chosen so as to be as representative as possible of the entire ensemble, with respect to the specific climate indices that are most relevant in the context of the application. To achieve this, users are advised to identify and focus on the dominant sources of variation of these indices within the ensemble. For example, in a situation where the GCMs are responsible for 90% of the variation in the indices of interest, the chosen sample of ensemble members should contain runs driven by contrasting GCMs but the choice of RCM is relatively unimportant.",
    "The dominant sources of variation in an ensemble are index-dependent. To identify a appropriate set of ensemble members for use in applications examining the impacts of, or adaptation to, future changes in UK climate, a suggested usage of this plot explorer tool is:",
