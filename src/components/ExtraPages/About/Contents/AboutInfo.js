    `The Met Office's UK Climate Projections (UKCP18) provide several different products giving information about the future climate of the UK, including projections at global (60km), regional (12km) and local (2.2km) scales. Although the regional projections are proving beneficial in understanding future climate risks, these were derived by perturbing the physical parameters of a single global climate model (GCM) and a single regional climate model (RCM), and so may not sample the full range of possible futures that is consistent with current scientific understanding. A more comprehensive assessment of potential climate futures for the UK can be obtained by supplementing the UKCP18 regional projections with information from the EuroCORDEX ensemble at the same 12km resolution. This combined set will allow a better understanding of structural uncertainty in UK climate projections and substantially enhances the information base available to support future climate change risk assessments.`,
    `This plot explorer is designed to enable rapid visualisation of the key structures of the model outputs in the UKCP18 projections and EuroCORDEX ensembles, along with their driving models, for a large number of weather variables and derived indices of climate over the UK. This enables users both to evaluate the outputs, and to choose appropriate subsets of model runs for use in their own applications.`,
